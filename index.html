            <h2>Project Introduction</h2>
            <p>This digital humanities project visualizes the journey described in Jules Verne's classic novel "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea". It uses an interactive map to show the time, locations and events, as well as marine life encountered by Captain Nemo and his crew aboard the Nautilus.
            </b><br><br>In the first step of the project, text mining was used to model the theme of 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea, identify the main plots in the novel, analyze the different chapters and characters, understand the story plot, and construct a character diagram to show the interaction and relationship between the main characters.
            </b><br><br>Based on the first step, we created a GIS interactive map that uses geographic information technology to visualize the various geographic locations and sailing routes mentioned in the novel, showing the adventures of Professor Arronax and his companions around the globe. To enrich the interactive experience, we created a chapter section that shows the time progression of the story and the sequence of major events, and marked the specific locations mentioned in the story and filled in the brief introductions of halobios on the map.
