                <p>In Jules Verne's "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea," the Nautilus is a fictional submarine whose detailed design and internal structure reflect Verne's imaginative vision of future technology. Here is an overview of the Nautilus's internal structure:
                <h2>Hull Structure</h2>
                <br><b>1. Outer Shell: </b>Made of robust steel, capable of withstanding the immense pressures of the deep sea, ensuring the submarine's safety at great depths.
                <br><b>2. Propulsion System: </b>The Nautilus uses an electric propulsion system, powered by onboard batteries. These batteries generate electricity through a sodium-mercury reaction with seawater. This setup was highly advanced for its time, anticipating future submarine propulsion technologies.
