                <p>In Jules Verne's "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea," the Nautilus is a fictional submarine whose detailed design and internal structure reflect Verne's imaginative vision of future technology. Here is an overview of the Nautilus's structure:<br>     
                    <h2>Hull Structure</h2>
                <br><b>1. Outer Shell: </b>Made of robust steel, capable of withstanding the immense pressures of the deep sea, ensuring the submarine's safety at great depths.
                <br><b>2. Double Nailed Hull: </b>Provides extra protection and structural strength, enabling the Nautilus to withstand the pressure of deep-sea environments.
                <br><b>3. Ballast Areas: </b>Crucial for managing the submarine's buoyancy, enabling it to submerge and surface as needed. The ballast tanks can be filled with water to dive and emptied to ascend.
                    <h2>Special Features</h2>
                <br><b>1. Diving Chamber: </b>Used for crew members to exit the submarine for underwater exploration and maintenance. It is equipped with diving suits and exit mechanisms.
                <br><b>2. Underwater Tunnel: </b>Connects the diving chamber to the outside, allowing crew members to safely enter and exit the Nautilus for underwater activities.

                <p>
                    <h2>External Structure</h2>
                <br><b>1. Reinforced Prow: </b>The front of the Nautilus features a robust and reinforced prow designed for ramming obstacles or enemies.
                <br><b>2. Horizontal Stabilizers/Dive Planes: </b>Located along the sides of the submarine, these stabilizers and dive planes help maintain the vessel's stability and control its depth and orientation while underwater.
                <br><b>3. Propulsion System:</b>
                <br><b>4. Rudder: </b>Helps steer and control the direction of the Nautilus.
                <br><b>5. Skiff: </b>A small auxiliary boat stored on board, which can be deployed for emergency escapes or short exploration missions.
                <br><b>6. Observation Platform: </b>Includes a periscope or transparent windows for viewing the ocean, allowing the crew to observe their surroundings while remaining submerged.
                    <h2>Internal Layout</h2>
                <br><b>1. Captain's Quarters: </b>Captain Nemo's private space, luxuriously decorated with books, musical instruments, and artworks, reflecting his cultural sophistication and personality.
                <br><b>2. Salon/Drawing Room: </b>A spacious social and recreational area equipped with a library, drawing tools, and scientific instruments, used for interaction and entertainment by the crew and guests.
                <br><b>3. Library: </b>Contains a vast collection of books, maps, and charts. It's a frequent retreat for Professor Aronnax and a vital space for the crew's education and leisure.
                <br><b>4. Guest Cabin: </b>Rooms provided for guests or scientists, typically where Professor Aronnax and his companions stayed.
                <br><b>5. Dining Room: </b>Where the crew dines, primarily serving food sourced from the ocean, including various seafood and seaweed.
                <br><b>6. Kitchen/Stores: </b>The space for cooking and storing food, beverages, and other essentials.
                <br><b>7. Crew Quarters: </b>Provides space for the crew to rest and sleep. The quarters are compact but comfortable.   
                <br><b>8. Engine Room: </b>Houses the power generation equipment and propulsion systems, making it one of the critical areas of the Nautilus.  
                <br><b>9. Battery Area: </b>Stores the power batteries that supply energy to the submarine.
                <br><b>10. Water Ballast Area: </b>Balancing tanks located at the front and rear, used to control the buoyancy and diving depth of the submarine.
                </p>    
            <p>The design of the Nautilus in the novel not only showcases Verne's rich imagination but also reflects his deep understanding of technological advancements and his anticipation of future marine exploration. The submarine has become an iconic symbol in science fiction literature, inspiring countless scientists and engineers in later years.
